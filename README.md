# 👋 Hi there! I'm Flora Dev

Welcome to my GitHub profile — I'm the creator of **InFlora**, a crypto-economic game inspired by nature, sustainability, and fair tokenomics. 🌿💡

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a developer who blends creativity, strategy, and technology to build meaningful Web3 projects. My work is driven by a strong passion for decentralization, gamified economies, and a fairer crypto ecosystem. I'm currently working on building the **InFlora** universe — a multichain, deflationary, and community-first game that simulates sustainable digital economies.
