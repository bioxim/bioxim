## **_Projects_**

| Name | Link | Brief |
|---|---|---|
| Early Projects | [**_Early Projects_**](#early-projects) | My first steps into IT
| Project Euler | [**_Project Euler's solved problems_**](#project-eulers-solved-problems) | The solution of several logical problems proposed in projecteuler.net
| Web Resume | [**_My Online Resume_**](#my-online-resume) | The 3 versions of my resume, using different technologies

### **_My Online Resume_**
The first sketch of my website resume was written in _html-css_ and _javascript_.  A static context of what I wanted to show in my profile.

Despite the fact that in a second stage of this project I modified the code and adapted it using React.js and Strapi for future dynamic content such as blog posts and entries to the portfolio section, I found 2 limitations: Strapi does not have the possibility of pagination (at least applied to React) and secondly github-pages does not accept dynamic content, but it does accept internal fetch requests, that's why I decided to take advantage of github with a really cheap personal domain.

### **_Project Euler's solved problems_**
In _[Project Euler's site](https://projecteuler.net/)_ we found many logical problems to be solved through computer algorithms where you can filter them by difficulty, solved by or id.  There are almost 800 and every single one involves free time to concentrate enough.  I am using Pyhton in order to practise for future data science personal researchs such as Panda or Numpy.

### **_Early Projects_**
After building some simple sites with joomla and wordpress one of those for the company I hab been working at that time it was around 2015-2017 I've decided to do that ambitious project wich includes filter and processing a large amount of data in datables from NOSIS app.  I called itself "Foobe" food and beverages trading stats with graphs and tables full of custom operations.

It was too much for me, I still have a lot to learn, but I did encourage myself to follow this project for a while until 2020.  Something I left documentated in github:
