Originally intended for constraint programming, CHR finds applications in grammar induction, type systems, abductive reasoning, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, compilation, scheduling, spatial-temporal reasoning, testing, and verification. A CHR program, sometimes called a constraint handler, is a set of rules that maintain a constraint store, a multi-set of logical formulas. Execution of rules may add or remove formulas from the store, thus changing the state of the program. The order in which rules fire on a given constraint store is non-deterministic, according to its abstract semantics and deterministic (top-down rule application), according to its refined semantics.",
